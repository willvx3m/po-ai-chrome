# GPU and PSU Recommendation for Model Training

## Overview
This document outlines the selection of the **ASUS GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Prime OC** as the optimal GPU for training a 20M-parameter model with 4M input data points on a Linux system with an Intel Core i7-8700 CPU. It also addresses the inadequacy of the current **Huntkey GS600 PSU** (500W continuous, 600W peak) and recommends a PSU upgrade for reliability during sustained model training workloads.

### Why Chosen
- **Model Training Fit**: The 16GB GDDR7 VRAM and 448 GB/s bandwidth handle your 20M-parameter model with 4M input data points (e.g., batch sizes ~32–128, mixed precision). 5th-gen Tensor cores accelerate AI tasks (e.g., ~29.44s in UL Procyon Flux.1 AI Image Generation, FP8) by ~15–20% over RTX 4060 Ti,.
- **Comparison to Alternatives**:
  - **RTX 4060 Ti 16GB**: Similar VRAM but slower GDDR6 (288 GB/s, 36% less bandwidth), ~13–20% lower AI performance, and no DLSS 4. Less future-proof despite lower cost (~$400–$450).
  - **RTX 4080 16GB**: ~2x AI performance (716.8 GB/s, 304 Tensor cores) but overkill, $1,199 MSRP, and requires 750W PSU.
  - **RTX 4090 24GB**: ~3.5x AI performance (1,008 GB/s, 24GB VRAM) but excessive, $1,599 MSRP, and needs 850W PSU.
- **Gaming Performance**: Excellent for 1440p (e.g., 99 FPS average, Cyberpunk 2077 RT Ultra: 90 FPS), matching your i7-8700’s capabilities,.
- **Linux Support**: Compatible with NVIDIA drivers (e.g., 560), CUDA 12.x, cuDNN 9.x for PyTorch/TensorFlow. DLSS 4 enhances AI-driven rendering if needed.

### System Compatibility
- **CPU**: Intel Core i7-8700 (~100–120W under load, ~43–45°C idle per `sensors`, ~60–70°C load).
- **Current GPU**: AMD GPU (~150–170W load, 178W cap, 49°C idle per `sensors`), replaced by RTX 5060 Ti.
- **Other Components**: Motherboard (~40W), 32GB RAM (~15W), SSD (~10W), fans (~25W).
- **Total System Power**:
  - **Average**: ~380W (~100W CPU + 180W GPU + 100W other).
  - **Peak**: ~475W (~120W CPU + 205W GPU + 150W other).

## PSU: Current Assessment and Upgrade Recommendation

### Current PSU: Huntkey GS600
- **Specifications**:
  - **Wattage**: 600W peak, 500W continuous (per user note).
  - **Efficiency**: 80 PLUS Bronze (~85% at 50–80% load).
  - **Connectors**: 2x 6+2-pin PCIe (1x needed for RTX 5060 Ti).
  - **ATX Version**: Likely 2.x (e.g., 2.4, ~2018).
  - **Age**: ~7 years (assumed from i7-8700’s 2018 release).
- **Assessment**:
  - **Pros**: 600W peak and 2x 6+2-pin PCIe meet RTX 5060 Ti’s requirements. Handles current AMD GPU (~150–170W load, per `sensors`).
  - **Cons**: 500W continuous rating is insufficient for ~475W peak (~95% load, exceeding safe ~80–85%). ~7-year age risks capacitor degradation, and budget brand (Huntkey) reduces reliability for sustained training.
  - **Verdict**: Likely insufficient for long training runs (hours to days) due to high load and aging components. Risks crashes, voltage drops, or failure.

### Recommended PSU Upgrade
To ensure stability and protect the RTX 5060 Ti during model training, upgrade to a 600–650W PSU with higher reliability.

#### Requirements
- **Wattage**: 600–650W (continuous) for ~20–30% headroom (~475W peak ÷ 0.85 efficiency ≈ 560W).
- **Efficiency**: 80 PLUS Gold for better efficiency than GS600’s Bronze.
- **Connectors**: 2x 6+2-pin PCIe (1x needed, 2x for future-proofing).
- **ATX Version**: 3.x preferred for transient handling; 2.x sufficient.

### Linux Steps to Verify Compatibility and Ensure Stability

#### Before Installing RTX 5060 Ti
Test the Huntkey GS600 with your current AMD GPU and i7-8700 to confirm stability at ~350–400W:
1. **Install Tools**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install lm-sensors psensor stress mesa-utils
   ```
2. **Stress CPU**:
   ```bash
   stress --cpu 6 --timeout 60
   ```
   Monitor with:
   ```bash
   sensors
   psensor
   ```
   Expect ~100–120W, temps ~60–70°C (below 82°C).
3. **Stress GPU**:
   ```bash
   glxgears
   ```
   Or use a training script. Check:
   ```bash
   sensors
   ```
   Expect ~150–170W, temps ~60–70°C (below 91°C).
4. **Combined Stress**:
   ```bash
   stress --cpu 6 --timeout 60 & glxgears
   ```
   If crashes, reboots, or PSU noise occur, upgrade PSU before installing RTX 5060 Ti.
5. **Check Connectors**:
   - Power off and unplug PC.
   - Confirm GS600 has 1x 6+2-pin PCIe cable (2x available). Avoid Molex-to-PCIe adapters.

#### After Installing RTX 5060 Ti
1. **Install NVIDIA Drivers**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nvidia-driver-560 nvidia-utils-560
   ```
   Or:
   ```bash
   ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
   ```
2. **Monitor GPU**:
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```
   Run training script or `glxgears`. Expect:
   - Power: ~155–205W.
   - Temperature: ~58–65°C.
3. **Stress Test System**:
   ```bash
   stress --cpu 6 --timeout 60 & glxgears
   ```
   Monitor `nvidia-smi` and `sensors`. Ensure stability at ~380–475W, CPU temps <82°C, GPU temps <70°C.
4. **Mitigate Instability**:
   - If crashes occur, undervolt:
     ```bash
     sudo nvidia-smi -pl 160
     ```
   - Persistent issues require PSU upgrade.

### Final Recommendations
- **GPU**: The **ASUS RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Prime OC** is the best choice for your 20M-parameter model with 4M input data points. Its 16GB GDDR7, 448 GB/s bandwidth, and 5th-gen Tensor cores ensure efficient training, ~15–20% faster than RTX 4060 Ti, at a lower cost ($429 vs. $1,199/$1,599 for RTX 4080/4090). It’s ideal for 1440p gaming and matches your i7-8700.
- **PSU**: The **Huntkey GS600** (500W continuous) is insufficient for the ~475W peak system draw (~95% load) and risky due to ~7-year age and budget brand. Upgrade to a **Corsair CX650** (~$60–$80) or **ASUS TUF Gaming 650W Gold** (~$90–$110) for ~20–30% headroom (~73–79% load), ensuring stability and protecting your RTX 5060 Ti.
- **Action Plan**:
  - Test GS600 stability with current AMD GPU (`stress` and `glxgears`).
  - Upgrade to a 600–650W PSU before installing RTX 5060 Ti to avoid risks.
  - Post-installation, monitor with `nvidia-smi` and optimize training with mixed precision (FP16/BF16) in PyTorch/TensorFlow.
